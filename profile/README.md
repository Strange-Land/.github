## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to StrangeLand

StrangeLand is a cutting-edge simulator designed to profile and understand human driving behavior across different cultures using a multi-participant virtual reality (VR) environment. As we transition to an era of autonomous vehicles, the ability to adapt to local driving norms becomes critical. StrangeLand aims to bridge this gap by providing a platform that captures and analyzes driving interactions, offering valuable insights for both researchers and developers.

### Repositories

StrangeLand consists of several repositories that together form a comprehensive ecosystem for VR driving simulation and analysis. Below is a brief overview of each repository:

#### 1. [StrangeLand-Base](https://github.com/Strange-Land/StrangeLand-Base/tree/development)
This is the core repository of the StrangeLand system. It contains the foundational code and assets necessary to set up and run the VR driving simulations. Start here if you're new to the StrangeLand ecosystem.

#### 2. [Docs-ReadMe](https://github.com/Strange-Land/Docs-ReadMe)
This repository houses all the documentation related to the StrangeLand project. Here you can find detailed guides, and more to help you navigate and utilize the various components of the StrangeLand system.

*Some Reportistries are still hosted on the originating labs Github*
#### 3. [ReRun](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Rerun)
It is an addition to StrangeLand that can be used to record the various moving actors in a scene and play them back, facilitating inductive coding for the transpired interactions.
#### 4. [Original Repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/CrossCulturalDriving)
The simulator's original repository has a longer history and various issues trackers associated with it that were not migrated to the new StrangeLand-Base repository.

### Future Developments

StrangeLand is continuously evolving. Our future plans for development are divided into two main areas:

#### 1. Studies
We aim to expand the cultural profiling capabilities of StrangeLand by incorporating more diverse driving scenarios, pedestrians, robots, and modern forms of transportation, to studying their effects on driving in different cultural contexts. The goal is to make StrangeLand a universal tool for multiparticipant interactin research moving beyond the traffic and driving context.

#### 2. Technical Improvements
Several enhancements are planned to improve the fidelity and usability of the StrangeLand system. These include better hand-tracking integration, more robust network performance, and the inclusion of additional real-world driving conditions to make the simulations even more realistic.

### History

StrangeLand began as an experimental system developed at Cornell Tech and the Technion in Israel, aiming to understand driving culture through VR. The system has since grown into a versatile tool for driving research, capable of capturing intricate details of driver interaction in various cultural settings. The project has been validated through proof-of-concept studies in multiple locations, showcasing its potential as a powerful tool for driving behavior research.

We invite you to explore, contribute, and help us shape the future of autonomous driving technology by engaging with the StrangeLand project.
